    "description": "Rock & roll is alive and kicking and in this talk I will showcase that Vue is so versatile it can be used to do audio visualisations while rock guitar soars through the browser. The audience will have access to a vue application which allows them to vote for a song to be played live on stage. The screen shows all the votes and I play them as they come up. While playing music meta data is shown and an audio visualisation plays while I’m rocking on stage. The more votes a song gets, the higher it shows on the list and the more chance I’ll play it. The whole experience is created using Vue and Uniform. Next to waking the audience up with some spicy rock& roll, I will explain how the software was build and why Vue is such an important technology for composable architectures with multiple channels.\n\nhttps://www.jsworldconference.com/newsletter\n\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#jsworld #jsworldconference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascript #reactjs #angular #react #vuejs #vue #vue3 #typescript #graphql #jamstack #amsterdam #conference #svelte #sveltejs #next #nextjs #staticsite #css #html #nuxt",

What you often see in composable e-commerce is that the product information lives in a specialized management system (a PIM), the content of the website in a CMS, and commerce features such as a cart, checkout, account, and payments in yet another system (a commerce engine).\n\nIn this example, all pages, content, and media are stored in Hygraph, but the products come from an external system – in this case, a mock API called Federate This. We expose the data in Hygraph via Content Federation. Developers query the CMS for product data, while editors can use the data inside the CMS while they combine editing native and federated content as if it were the same. The beauty is that developers and content editors do not need to understand the external product API as they use it directly through Hygraph.\n\nFederate This: https://federatethis.com\nHygraph: https://hygraph.com\nHygraph Community: https://slack.hygraph.com",

    "description": "In this live stream our host Tim Benniks interviews special guest Jasmin Guthmann with the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is an unexpected or surprising outcome of transitioning from a monolithic to a composable architecture?\r\n2. If you had to advise agency or SaaS company execs, what would it be?\r\n3. If you could wave a magic wand and change something in our space, what would it be?\r\n4. What bottlenecks have you seen in composable architectures? This could be any bottleneck, from tech to process.\r\n5. What feature from old technology would you like to bring back?\r\n6. How would you explain composable architectures to a 15 year old?\r\n\r\n\r\nLivestream Host: Tim Benniks \r\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/timbenniks/\r\n\r\nJoin us on Discord at https://uniform.to/discord\r\nLearn more at https://uniform.dev\r\n\r\nFollow us on:\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Uniform/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/UniformDev \r\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/uniformdev \r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/uniform.dev/",

I found a way to love Sitecore again by decoupling its content management and front-end rendering parts. You can use @UniformVisualWorkspace to select content from a Sitecore instance and funnel it into any front end you desire. \n\nThis approach gives you developer freedom, a way to add any other headless source without worry, and you can host anywhere you want. Say goodbye to your slow and expensive CD servers! \n\nIn this video, I use Nuxt 3 for the rendering - because why not!?\n\nFind out more about #Uniform at https://uniform.dev\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks",

    "description": "My conference talk from VueConf Toronto!\n\nCable management for Nuxt 3. Compose pages with multiple headless sources and never re-platform again…\n\nNow that companies are starting to use multiple different headless sources to create their digital experience platforms, a real problem is forming. Content editors need to create pages with products, CMS content, videos and personalisation but all these things come from different vendors.\n\nThey have no overview over what to do and they always have to ask a developer to connect things together in the front-end. Developers generally have no time so frustration kicks in.\n\nWe need a way to compose pages with different headless sources without too much developer involvement. Marketers need to be free to tell their stories when and how they want to. BUT. Developers also need to be happy. They need complete freedom in their tech stack and in how they choose to build a website.\n\nSounds like a dream come true? In this talk I’ll show you how to connect up different headless sources in a very easy to use system and how query them in the front-end without tight coupling. \n\nLet’s Nuxtify the world!\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks",

JavaScript bundles need to be downloaded, parsed and executed by the browser.

    "title": "Magical combination to build a modern website",
    "description": "Yes, I did it again. I rebuilt my website!\n\nMy website, https://timbenniks.dev, serves as my blog and a repository of my videos and speaking schedule. Though rich in content, the site is fast, accessible, and, most important, has a low carbon footprint. Under optimal conditions, the site scores 100 percent in Lighthouse.\n\nI recently rebuilt the site with several tools, the combination of which is ideal for modern web development. I’m excited about the result of the revamp. Let’s see how long that thrill lasts!\n\nI picked Nuxt version 2.14, which offers the excellent \"target: static\" option, outputting a static website on build. You probably guessed it already: my website adopts the Jamstack model. Jamstack websites are light and easy to distribute, with no reliance on dynamic content at all.\n\nEver tried hacking a static site? That’s hard to do. Also, if you need to scale it to meet demand, simply put it in more places on the content delivery network (CDN). After all, it's only a bunch of static files.\n\nHosting\nFor a smooth sail with Jamstack, I needed a hosting provider for the static assets on the CDN edge with simple capabilities for building and deploying my codebase. Netlify hosted my website before, but I wanted to try another provider for an insight into Netlify’s competition. Vercel, the provider I chose, was effortless to use. A nice surprise!\n\nCMS\nI picked Prismic, a great headless CMS whose features outshine those offered by huge enterprise systems. In particular, Prismic has resolved the rich-text issue many CMSs struggle with. I was also impressed by Prismic’s component-based design system, called slices, with which I can create pages in a component-driven way. I highly recommend checking out Prismic.\n\nSearching and filtering\nTo facilitate filtering of video content, I chose Algolia for indexing through its SaaS platform. The initial setup leveraged Algolia’s Vue.js components, which, despite a rather big footprint, do a lot of heavy lifting. Do have a look at Algolia in action on the site’s video page.\n\nOrchestrating the communication between best-of breed products like Algolia and Prismic is no trivial task. The challenge I faced was to ensure that Angolia updates the index when I add new videos to the Prismic. To make that happen, I created a Vercel lambda function, which is called with a webhook whenever I add a video. The function then queries the CMS for the new video data, after which the lambda updates the video index with the Algolia API. Voila, sheer magic!\n\nWebhooks are useful in decoupled architectures. I set up webhooks to also call Vercel when I publish content. On receiving a ping from a Prismic webhook, Vercel rebuilds the site and updates the CDN edge. Similarly, when I push updated code to GitHub, Vercel redeploys the site.\n\nWebhooks are the glue that helps automate the system. Thanks to Vercel’s high speed, I could deploy a hundred times a day without any part of the system breaking a sweat.\n\nImages\nCloudinary, another best-of-breed system I’ve been using for years, was an obvious choice. Even though Prismic offers an excellent feature set for managing images, Cloudinary struck me as being a better fit.\n\nThe process was straightforward. First, I sent the Prismic images to Cloudinary with the Nuxt Cloudinary module through the fetch system. From there, I transformed the images with the Cloudinary API slated for image URLs, e.g., by changing the file-type-based browser context and by resizing, scaling, and cropping the images accordingly.\n\nIt's open source: https://github.com/timbenniks/timbenniks2020-nuxt\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#jamstack #dxp #googleaudit",

I now focus on creating content about web development topics and soft skills for people of all levels.\n\nI truly enjoy doing community driven work and people seem to like what I have to say. I'm a lucky duck!\n\nI'm committed to delivering a new video every week! These videos don't just appear, they are A LOT of work. I want to always get you the best content and this takes a bunch of time. I also need the right gear to keep delivering high production quality.\n\nIf you decide to sponsor me I will love you forever! 😘 All donations will go right back into the content creation efforts. I'll use the money to buy audio/video/light gear. Or, I will try out paid services for the Tim Tries video series.

It could very well be that one of the more junior people take the leadership role. Managers you \"have\" to listen to. Leaders you \"want\" to listen to. \n\nBy a complex situation I mean a high pressure project with a big scope and not enough time, and on top the client is immature and is always upset.

This talk helps developers to make changes to their code so that their website has a lower carbon footprint.\n\nIf the internet was a country, it would be the world’s sixth biggest polluter. The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 466TWh per year to be precise. That’s more than the entire United Kingdom (300TWh)! \n\nCarbon emissions are generated all over the place, from data centers to our personal devices. The average website produces 1.76 grams CO2 per page view. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 211 kg CO2 per year. These are staggering numbers and they will only go up as the internet is growing at a frightening rate. To make the internet more sustainable, web developers have three areas of attention.\n\n1. Design and content\n2. Front-end development best practices\n3. Server architecture choices",

Scott and his buddy Wes Bos go in-depth on code stuff and teach each-other new things.\n\nThe interview is wide ranging and we go over how to create for YouTube and to how to manage social media. We also discuss how Scott learnt to fail and get success after by being a Bboy with the Robotops Crew.\n\nIn this video series I interview people that are amazing at their jobs in the tech industry.

The app shows how much weight I have lost and it tweets an update into the world every time I step on my WiFi enabled scale. In this video I explain how it all connects!\n\nNext to talking about the tech that powers the Fatty app I also tell about my fitness story.

    "title": "[Livestream] Team First - How to lead a team to success in a high pressure environment",
    "description": "Producing high quality work is dependent on a well-organized team, especially in a high-pressure environment like an ad agency or a production studio. At a certain scale almost every team struggles with cultural differences, perceived pressure from management or misaligned definitions of success.\n\nThese examples are only a handful of the problems teams face, which results in developers that are unhappy and stressed out. Processes outside of their control keep them from doing the thing they love: write great code.\n\nOver the years I have learned that you are more successful if you understand what motivates people. We know happy teams produce better work. Motivated and responsible people are the core of our success. Therefore, I have created a framework (yes, I'm a developer) to deal with projects in complex environments that I call \"Team First\".\n\nThis video is about how the \"Team First\" framework came to be and how it works. It contains best practices and rules to follow in order to make yourself and your team successful. I share anecdotes from years of experience that most developers can identify with.\n\nBefore writing a single line of code you have to deal with all challenges that prohibit you from producing a quality product. The \"Team First\" framework helps leaders, teams and developers get there.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#teamfirst #career #management #motivation",

    "description": "In today’s digital landscape, data-driven experimentation has become the lynchpin of growth strategies. “Build, test, tear down and repeat” has become a mantra for businesses focused on product-led growth and customer acquisition loops. With a composable architecture based on MACH principles, businesses have the essential pieces in place to apply growth principles to the very brands they put in front of customers.\n\nBy both removing the technical barriers that slow down the launch of a consistent, repeatable stack and adopting an architecture that allows for an ultra-flexible approach to front-end component design, forward-thinking companies can hyper-target sub-brands, audience segments, global regions, verticals, or product categories - without starting from scratch every time a new site needs to be built. While much of the content may be the same as the master brand site, companies can build a site to support a specific play, test its performance with the target audience, tear it down and repeat.\n\nScaffolding composable stacks need to be more accessible to all stakeholders and not just a tech team.\n\nWhat it does\n\nFor our MACHathon Accelerate entry, team \"Rage against the MACHine\" has collaborated to deliver a next-gen MVP for a “composable commerce stack accelerator” based on Uniform experience orchestration, a BigCommerce headless commerce, and Contentstack headless CMS. This software offers the ability to scaffold new stacks easily as a business user, test performance, tear them down, then repeat.",

    "description": "Article here: https://dev.to/timbenniks/the-future-of-jamstack-is-composable-3m7g\n\nIn modern web architecture, we are faced with the daunting task of composing headless sources together into a cohesive experience that feels like one system for all stakeholders. Many consider the roadblocks to be technical, but they are also organisational. This is mainly because there is no more centre of the universe - the origin server - that controls everything. Headless sources are API-first and need to be integrated to create a website or app. Without an origin server, content editors, marketers and developers alike need to connect to different systems to get things done. Mildly put, this is a struggle and, in the words of actual people I’ve worked with: a dumpster fire.\n\nIn this video:\nYou will learn about the two things you need to create high quality, easy to manage, secure and performant front-ends that don't make a bespoke architecture or a monolith of modern tech.\n\n1. Use the Jamstack with your favourite framework and host on your favourite CDN.\n2. Behind it all, you have an orchestration platform that is vendor agnostic, has a killer SDK and gives all team members the ability to compose content without bothering developers.\n\nCombining these two things will make your digital pipeline run smoothly and future proof the investments made. You can add legacy platforms as data sources if you have the right orchestration platform. You can slowly but surely transition away from them without doing a big-bang change offering big brands a safe path into the future.",

    "description": "Uniform is excited about some new features for Contentful headless CMS users - check out this video to see these in action:\n\nMulti-space support\nContentful customers can now connect Uniform components to any space (or environment) in their account. This means that once developers wire up components to various spaces, business users can easily use our no-code editor to build experiences without needing to understand where content is coming from. The final page will present *ahem* a Uniform experience for end users. Of course, you can run A/B tests and personalization on every component too. And a bonus - this works at the environment level too, so components can even pull from specific space environments.\nRead the documentation here: https://docs.uniform.app/canvas/tutorials/add-contentful/#connecting-to-multiple-contentful-spaces\n\nIntroducing patterns\nBuilding digital experiences at scale can be repetitive and eat up development time. We’ve added patterns - a way to share a component (which could also contain other components) between multiple compositions. For example, you could use a pattern to share a legal disclaimer, news release author bio, or standard global header across many compositions. These can also be revised once added to a composition, so developers can accelerate build times when designing large sites.\nRead the documentation here: https://docs.uniform.app/canvas/tutorials/patterns\n\nLocalization for global marketing and ecommerce\nUniform components and compositions can now be localized. In addition to localizing content inside Contentful, users can now localize front-end components inside Uniform - giving users more flexibility when it comes to adopting a localization strategy. Both devs and business users get full flexibility with the ability to localize at any level - composition, component, and content.",

    "description": "See more at: https://uniform.to/zzkFwx\n\nIn recent years we've seen a lot of change in how enterprises use digital experiences to drive customer engagement and e-commerce.\n\nAlong with an explosion of infrastructure and tech stack options, decoupling from monolithic suites has offered more flexibility than ever.\n\nBut, traversing the headless landscape and orchestrating it into a cohesive architecture can present challenges, particularly as the number of business-critical tools behind great experiences continues to change and grow over time.\n\nToo often, that means that businesses need more and more developer expertise to tell their stories. And this at a time when developers are in short supply.\n\nContent editors and marketers are left struggling to keep up and frustrated by a lack of control they may have enjoyed with traditional suites.\n\nThat's why we're excited to announce Uniform, the world’s first truly composable DXP.\nAs a frictionless, composable digital experience platform, Uniform gives companies the power of choice to continuously adopt new tech without ever re-platforming.\n\nFront and center is the power of choice. Choose your own headless sources, your own tech stack and your own hosting. You can connect CMS, CRM and Commerce platforms with ease.\n\nUniform is completely opinion-less and therefore offers true composability. Not one integration is the center of the universe and all parts are equal. It acts as a platform to orchestrate both traditional and headless sources without telling marketers or developers what to do. Yes, you can even treat select monolithic systems like Sitecore as a headless source in Uniform.\n\nAnd with Uniform Canvas, you get powerful no-code tools to allow marketers to retain control over composition, personalization, A/B testing and managing brand experiences without developer support.\n\nUniform Canvas allows business users to seamlessly create engaging experiences based on a multitude of headless and legacy sources without concern for which systems that data is coming from, with instant preview allowing them to understand how changes impact a finished experience. Even when their tech stack changes over time.\n\nUniform ensures your team can continue to deliver incredible experiences as your architecture evolves. After all, change is the only constant. Super fast site performance, enterprise-grade security and great Core Web Vitals is only the beginning. Start telling your story now with Uniform.",

    "description": "See more at: https://uniform.to/zzkFwx\n\nIn an ever expanding landscape of headless sources, developers are often the ones who have to connect them all. \n\nThe question of adding some products, content and personalization on one landing page always comes at a time developers are busy. The answer is generally “no” or a forced “yes, I’ll try to squeeze it in this week”.\n\nWouldn't it be cool if you only had to implement one SDK in your framework of choice and you never had to bother with this stuff again? This sounds too good to be true right? Let’s discuss what this SDK would look like.\n\nIt would allow content editors to drag and drop content from different headless sources to their heart’s content. They could add or remove integrations and even do an A/B test or add some personalization without having to wait for developers.\n\nIf the headless sources change, it would still work exactly the same way on the other end. Retrieve a page composition through an SDK function, map and enhance data to your liking and pass it as props to existing components. Regardless of tech stack, it would just work.\n\nI’m here to tell you we’ve actually built this. We proudly introduce Uniform, the world’s first truly composable DXP. The only DXP that gives developers the power of choice: from front-end framework to CDN to hosting as SSR, Jamstack, with Edge workers, partial SSG, anything goes.\n\nUniform offers a platform without opinion, without vendor lock-in and without a restricting roadmap. Not one integration is the center of the universe and nothing is tightly coupled.\nWant three different CMS systems and two commerce engines? Why not? Add an integration, query the data and map it to props for your components to use.\n\nNext to true composability regardless of tech stack, we’ve also introduced Uniform Canvas, a no-code composition builder that allows non-technical users to create experiences based on the components you define.\n\nUniform Canvas also provides a preview API with websockets, so end users can preview their composition live and in the actual codebase of the final product.\n\nUniform comes with an extremely flexible data enhancer API to help you map data from headless sources into your app. This API can run in your codebase or as an external service. We don’t care. Everything is built with flexibility in mind. You have the power of choice at your side.\n\nWe at Uniform know happy developers do better work. Good DX and great SDKs are just the beginning. With Uniform you can connect all the dots the way you like from a tech perspective. With a combination of out of the box tools for a fast time to market, and a set of APIs that allow extreme precision, we have created the world’s first truly composable DXP that will make both developers and content editors happy.",

The modern web is origin-less and Jamstack allows us to make that happen.\n\nStatic sites allow for easy scaling. They also score high core web vitals due to extremely fast TTFB and the use of modern web frameworks such as Next and Nuxt. API calls and data mapping happen at build time so at runtime nothing time consuming has to happen.\n\nStill need dynamic stuff for personalization, A/B testing, product catalogs or user logins? Use CDN edge workers or #serverless functions that run on the same CDN instance as the site so they are blazing fast and close to the end user.\n\nFor the business users among you: Highly performant web pages lead to higher conversion rates and better SEO. They also scale without issue during the black Friday peak.\n\nFor the developers among you: Jamstack sites allow developers to choose their stack freely as the end result is a static site. Jamstack sites do not have an opinion of how they are build and where they run. They offer the #powerofchoice for developers.",

    "description": "In this video we will discuss what true #composability is in the context of #DXP.\nNowadays, business leaders and developers are demanding freedom of choice across the board. And this puts traditional suite vendors in a state of chaos.They are trying to change the way they work while still staying mindful of the past 10 years of marketing the \"suite\" approach.\n\nThey are literally buying companies to try to create the feeling of composability while in fact they are only allowing you to compose with the components in their suite offering. You can't coin a term like composable DXP if you do not offer real flexibility.\n\nCustomers will still suffer from vendor lock-in, complex upgrade roadmaps and lot's of work to customize anything in the system. We've seen a huge explosion in digital experience tools over the past ten years, and the market is only moving faster. The tools you have today won't be the same tools you're using in 6 months time, or 2 years' time.\n\nTrue composability is the #powerofchoice in EVERYTHING. From Tech stack to hosting, CMS, media management, marketing tools, CDN, analytics, whatever.\n\nWe need an opinion-less platform in which nobody is the centre of the universe. A platform where all elements are equal and that offers flexibility and extendability whenever needed. Never re-platform again. Just switch out integrations.\n\nA truly composable DXP offers Freedom of choice in everything but with painkillers for orchestration and content composing.",
